            <br>Waking up in your bed
            <br>It's almost like I've been here forever
            <br>I'm obsessed with your brain
            <br>And I'd unfold it if you let me</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="chorus"><b><i>[Chorus: Lauv]</i></b>
            <br>What if we move to Canada
            <br>And buy some things we don't need?
            <br>Bring your mother's dog
            <br>Your paintbrush and some candy
            <br>And when they talk about those
            <br>People who up and leave
            <br>That could be us
            <br>That could be you and me</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="lauv"><b><i><span class="alessia">[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]</span></i></b>
            <br>How you talk with your hands
            <br>And how you sigh like a movie
            <br>And we got luck so bad we have to laugh
            <br>I guess we're lucky that we don't need much outside of us, do we?</span></p>

            <br>Your paintbrush and some candy

            <br>So, why don't we move to Canada
            <br>And buy some things we don't need?

            <br>Your paintbrush and some candy
            <br>And when they talk about those
