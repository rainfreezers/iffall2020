             <p><span class="lauv">[Verse 1: Lauv]</span>
             <br>Waking up in your bed
             <br>It's almost like I've been here forever
             <br>I'm obsessed with your brain
             <br>And I'd unfold it if you let me</p>

             <p><span class="lauv">[Chorus: Lauv]</span>
             <br>What if we move to Canada
             <br>And buy some things we don't need?
             <br>Bring your mother's dog
             <br>Your paintbrush and some candy
             <br>And when they talk about those
             <br>People who up and leave
             <br>That could be us
             <br>That could be you and me</p>

             <p><span class="lauv">[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]</span>
             <br>How you talk with your hands
             <br>And how you sigh like a movie
             <br>And we got luck so bad we have to laugh
             <br>I guess we're lucky that we don't need much outside of us, do we?</p>

             <p><span class="lauv">[Chorus: Lauv & Alessia Cara]</span>
             <br>What if we move to Canada
             <br>And buy some things we don't need?
             <br>Bring your mother's dog
             <br>Your paintbrush and some candy
             <br>And when they talk about those
             <br>People who up and leave
             <br>That could be us
             <br>That could be you and me</p>

             <p><span class="lauv">[Bridge: Lauv & Alessia Cara]</span>
             <br>Ah, that could be you and me
             <br>Ah, that could be you and me
             <br>Ah, that could be you and me
             <br>Ah</p>

             <p><span class="lauv">[Chorus: Lauv & Alessia Cara, Alessia Cara & Lauv]</span>
             <br>So, why don't we move to Canada
             <br>And buy some things we don't need?
             <br>Bring your mother's dog
             <br>Your paintbrush and some candy
             <br>And when they talk about those
             <br>People who up and leave
             <br>That could be us
             <br>That could be you and me
             <br>Move to Canada
             <br>And buy some things we don't need
             <br>Bring your mother's dog
             <br>Your paintbrush and some candy
             <br>And when they talk about those
             <br>People who up and leave
             <br>That could be us
             <br>That could be you and me</p>

             <p><span class="lauv">[Outro: Lauv]</span>
             <br>That could be you and me</p>
