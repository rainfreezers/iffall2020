        <p>1. I'm Selena and I'm a junior majoring in Communication Design and Marketing.</p>
        <p>2. I have a background in illustration, fine art, and graphic design, but I'm also interested in developing my UI/UX skills after doing an Adobe Creative Jam this summer.</p>
        <p>3. I have a tiny bit of experience with HTML/CSS, I attended a Sam Fox workshop for it.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn how to make appealing websites and apps!</p>
        <p>5. I expect designing for screen will be different because of all the interactive elements, and difference in perspective (more user-focused, readable type size is different, etc.)</p>
        <p>6. I think <a href="https://www.apple.com">this website</a> is effectively designed with a mix of dramatic photos and supporting typographic headings, and splitting big pictures into squares based on importance.</p>
        <p>7. I think <a href="https://oddfellows.tv">this website</a> exemplifies effective communication, because they introduce themselves upfront and efficiently show a few examples of their work in a short vertical scroll, with easy buttons to see more.</p>
        <p>8. I think <a href="https://www.glossier.com">this website</a> works well because it has a clean vertical scroll that isn't too long, and all the information someone may be interested in is presented up front in an appealing manner.</p>
